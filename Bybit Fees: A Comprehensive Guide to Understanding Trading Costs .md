## Fee Structure Breakdown

### 1. **Spot Trading Fees**

Spot trading involves buying and selling cryptocurrencies at the current market price. On Bybit, spot trading fees are relatively low compared to many other exchanges, which is an advantage for active traders.

| **Fee Type**     | **Fee**     |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Maker Fee**    | 0.10%       |
| **Taker Fee**    | 0.10%       |

#### Maker vs. Taker Fees

- **Maker Fee**: The maker fee is applied when a trader adds liquidity to the market by placing a limit order that does not get executed immediately. This order "makes" liquidity available for other traders to fill.
- **Taker Fee**: The taker fee is applied when a trader removes liquidity from the market by placing an order that gets filled immediately. This order "takes" liquidity from the order book.

Bybit’s spot trading fees for both makers and takers are identical, which is uncommon among exchanges. This makes Bybit a more affordable choice for traders who often make trades with market orders (takers).

### 2. **Futures Trading Fees (Derivatives)**

Futures trading allows traders to bet on the price movements of cryptocurrencies using leverage, which increases both potential profits and risks. Bybit offers competitive futures trading fees that are also divided into maker and taker fees.

| **Fee Type**     | **Fee**     |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Maker Fee**    | -0.025%     |
| **Taker Fee**    | 0.075%      |

#### Explanation of Futures Fees

- **Maker Fee**: When you place a limit order that adds liquidity to the market, you earn a rebate. This is a positive fee, meaning that makers actually receive 0.025% of the trade value.
- **Taker Fee**: When you place a market order that immediately fills, you will be charged a 0.075% fee for removing liquidity from the market.

Bybit’s competitive futures trading fees make it an attractive option for traders who want to leverage their positions. The negative maker fee incentivizes traders to provide liquidity to the market.

### 3. **Margin Trading Fees**

Margin trading allows traders to borrow funds to trade larger positions than their account balance would otherwise allow. This type of trading increases the potential for both profits and losses. Bybit offers margin trading with leverage of up to 5x on certain pairs.

#### Funding Fees

In margin trading, there is a concept called **funding fees**, which is a payment made between long and short traders based on the difference in contract prices. These funding fees occur periodically (every 8 hours) and are designed to help keep the futures price aligned with the spot price.

| **Funding Fee**  | **Rate**    |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Long Funding** | Paid to Short Positions |
| **Short Funding**| Paid to Long Positions |

Funding rates fluctuate based on market conditions and are generally updated every 8 hours. The rate is based on the difference between the perpetual futures price and the spot price.

## Fee Discounts and Promotions

One of the key benefits of trading on Bybit is that the platform offers several ways to reduce or eliminate trading fees, depending on certain conditions.

### 1. **Fee Discount for BIT Holders**

Bybit has its own native token, **BitDAO (BIT)**, which traders can hold to receive discounts on trading fees. The more BIT tokens you hold, the greater the discounts you can receive on both spot and futures trading.

- **How to Qualify for Fee Discounts**: To qualify for fee discounts, you need to hold a minimum amount of BIT in your account.
- **Discount Percentage**: Discounts can vary depending on the number of BIT tokens held in your account. Generally, the more BIT you hold, the higher the discount on trading fees.

### 2. **Referral Program**

Bybit offers a referral program where both the referrer and the referee can receive trading fee rebates. When a new user registers with a referral code, both users may receive a percentage of the trading fees as a rebate.

- **How It Works**: When a new user registers using your referral code, you can receive a percentage of their trading fees as a reward. This can be a valuable opportunity to reduce your own fees while helping others join the platform.

### 3. **VIP Program**

Bybit’s **VIP Program** offers higher-volume traders reduced trading fees and other perks, such as priority customer support, faster withdrawals, and higher withdrawal limits.

- **How to Qualify for VIP Status**: To qualify for the VIP program, you need to meet specific trading volume requirements. This is generally for professional and high-frequency traders.
- **VIP Tiers**: Bybit’s VIP program includes multiple tiers, with each tier offering different benefits, including fee discounts and personalized services.

## Other Fees and Costs to Consider

While Bybit offers low trading fees, there are a few other potential fees that users may encounter when trading on the platform.

### 1. **Withdrawal Fees**

Bybit charges a withdrawal fee when users move their funds off the platform. The withdrawal fee varies depending on the cryptocurrency being withdrawn. For example:

| **Cryptocurrency** | **Withdrawal Fee** |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| **BTC**            | 0.0005 BTC         |
| **ETH**            | 0.005 ETH          |
| **USDT (ERC-20)**  | 10 USDT            |
| **USDT (TRC-20)**  | 1 USDT             |

These fees are subject to change based on network congestion, so it's always a good idea to check the current withdrawal fee before transferring funds.

### 2. **Overnight Funding Fees for Leverage**

If you're trading with leverage, there are additional costs associated with overnight funding fees. These are interest fees that you need to pay or receive depending on your position. The funding fee is calculated based on your position size and the current interest rate.

### 3. **Inactivity Fees**

Bybit does not currently charge inactivity fees, which means users are not penalized for not trading for an extended period. This is advantageous for users who prefer to hold assets without incurring any additional costs.

## How to Minimize Fees on Bybit

Here are a few strategies that can help you minimize your fees when trading on Bybit:

### 1. **Use Limit Orders**

Bybit rewards liquidity providers (makers) by offering them a rebate on the maker fee. To take advantage of this, use **limit orders** instead of market orders. Limit orders allow you to place trades at a specific price, and if your order adds liquidity to the market, you’ll receive the maker fee rebate.

### 2. **Hold BIT Tokens**

As mentioned earlier, holding **BIT** tokens can help you qualify for discounts on trading fees. If you’re an active trader, this is an easy way to reduce your trading costs.

### 3. **Participate in the Referral Program**

Bybit’s referral program is a great way to earn trading fee rebates. If you regularly trade on Bybit, using referral links to sign up new users can significantly lower your costs.

### 4. **Become a VIP Member**

If you're an active trader with high trading volumes, becoming a **VIP member** on Bybit can help you access the lowest fees. VIP status also comes with other perks, such as higher withdrawal limits and faster customer support.
